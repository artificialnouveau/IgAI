## What is the objective of IgnobleAI

Often the goal of satire is to change cultural norms for the better by mocking social institutions, cultural norms and belief systems. IgnobleAI explores how customized machine learning design can be used as a humorous artistic practice and collaborate community practice Together we ask, how can we use humor AI to change existing norms around unethical machine learning practices? Given that we live in a data-hungry society where data-greedy tech companies strive on targeted ads and algorithmic design, what does it mean if the communities design their own machine learning algorithms as a form of protest? Community-based and ethically driven machine learning algorithms create an incentive for designing a more equitable future. IgnobleAI will advocate for the use of open-source technologies that communities to use to satire to bring about change by making us laugh at the weakness and flaws around AIâ€™s design and applications.
